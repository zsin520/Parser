# Parser

This program uses natural language toolkit to determine the structure of a sentence. Parsing a sentence can help the computer better understand the meaning of a sentence. For example, the computer can determine what the sentence is about. This program applies context free grammar rules to a sentence (nonterminal) until it generates a completely deconstructed sentence of words (terminals).
